      "content": "The Sinner who developed the engine of Mephistopheles, the bus operated by Limbus Company. She claims that there is no one in the City who could rival her library of knowledge and wisdom, and she isn't necessarily wrong. You might find her high and mighty attitude when she allows you to converse with her displeasing, but as seen with how she treats everyone with subtle gestures of arrogance, there is no hope of her parting with it, ever. We recommend simply nodding once and getting over it. Even though she has an unparalleled genius, we can't quite figure out how to use this one. Perhaps you could be the one to find out?"

His thoughts and feelings are blatantly visible in his demeanor, and he has no intention of hiding them; his brashness may cause headaches (or physical injury leading to a headache) in the process of forming a relationship. Please do note that this is not an indication of serious damage to the Sinner's thought process. If his fit of rage persists, please contact the human resources department. Once you realize that he is the type that tends to be simple-minded, you'll have an easier time handling him."
